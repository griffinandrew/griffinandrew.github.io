## About me
I am prospective Ph.D student in the areas of systems and robotics. I am passionate about collaborative learning and aim to inspire others to become lifelong learners through my research and teaching. In high school, I was duel-enrolled at the [County College of Morris](https://www.ccm.edu/) and graduated with Certificates in Mechanical Engineering Technology and Mechanical CAD in 2018. I went on to study mathematics and computer science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) while working at the [Boston University Morphable Biorobotics Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/ranzani-lab/)focusing on advanced control of surgical robots graduating in 2022. At the end of January, I will be joining [Red Hat Research](https://research.redhat.com/) as a research scientist intern working on cloud computing and distributed systems.


### Research Experience Areas
distributed systems, cloud and mobile computing, robotics, haptics, control, simulation, machine-learning, as well the fabrication of space hardware currently onbaord the International Space Station.

## Recent Work

### [Red Hat Research](https://research.redhat.com/)

I am extremeley excited to be joining Red Hat Research as a research scientist intern at the [Boston University - Red Hat Research Collaboratory](https://www.bu.edu/rhcollab/) working on open source distributed systems in the cloud and [Dr. Jonathan Appavoo's](https://www.bu.edu/cs/jonathan-appavoo/) [Foundations in Open Source Education](https://www.bu.edu/rhcollab/projects/distributed-systems/foundations-in-open-source-education/) project.

### [Boston University Morphable Biorobotics Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/ranzani-lab/)

I was fortunate enough to work under the mentorship of [Dr. Tommaso Ranzani](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/tommaso-ranzini-phd/) and [Jacob Rogatinsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobrogatinsky) working on advanced control methods for our labs surgical [robots](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aisy.202200085).

### [Dartmouth College Learning Intelligence and Signal Processing Lab](https://lisplab.host.dartmouth.edu/)

I was lucky to have the oppurtunity to work under the guidance of [Dr. Peter Chin](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/peter-chin) working on the multivariate time series forecasting of geospatial data for the NSF Algorithms for Threat Detection Challenge where our learning model placed seconf overall in a national competition.
